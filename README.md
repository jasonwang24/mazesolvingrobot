# Mazesolvingrobot
This is a robot that can traverse through a maze made of black lines. The robot will start at any point and make its way throughout
the maze, travelling through any turns or deadends. This project was programmed using arduino code and requires LDR sensors, an H-bridge,
wheels (caster). To see a demo of this car in action, use this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jQ3E77enqTr5tXgdfH23YhNEQ2DBl_U5
